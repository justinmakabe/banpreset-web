src/app/wishlist/page.tsx(33,31): error TS2352: Conversion of type '{ product_id: any; products: any[]; }[] | null' to type 'WishlistItem[]' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.
  Type '{ product_id: any; products: any[]; }[]' is not comparable to type 'WishlistItem[]'.
    Type '{ product_id: any; products: any[]; }' is not comparable to type 'WishlistItem'.
      Types of property 'products' are incompatible.
        Type 'any[]' is missing the following properties from type '{ id: string; name: string; price: number; image_url?: string | null | undefined; categories?: { name?: string | undefined; } | null | undefined; }': id, name, price
